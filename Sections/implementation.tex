\subsection{Bus Services Integration}

\subsubsection{The data mining process}

The integrity of the data on the Buyt TPHCM website is guaranteed due to its commissioning and maintenance by the Ho Chi Minh City Department of Transport. 

Several JavaScript source files power this site:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{L.Config.js:} This is a configuration file to set up the map rendering for Buyt TPHCM. The tiles are loaded from http://map.stis.vn/bright/{z}/{x}/{y}.png.
    \item \textbf{L.RouteMap.js:} This source file is responsible for showing the stops and bus routes. We were able to get the coordinate sets that we wanted by placing breakpoints on this site.
\end{itemize}
\subsubsection{Data storage of bus services}

\subsection{iOS App Development}
