\subsubsection{Development strategy}
We aim to deliver our iOS app to the Apple App Store, which would involve acquiring an Apple Developer Account and tailoring our app to suit Apple's developer guidelines. Because this process can take a long time due to the tedious nature of the Apple's review process, this work will be our major concern for the next phase of the project. 

At the same time, after having access to the Google Developer console for the existing Android app, we were able to determine two necessary tasks, which are the data collection declaration to Google regarding what UTraffic will collect from the users and the ability for the users to request for account deletion. This is explicitly required by both Google and Apple, and since UTraffic offers account creation, it must offer account deletion as well \cite{apple_account_deletion} \cite{google_account_deletion}.

Furthermore, since there is a group of students with a renovative ideas of implementing traffic camera viewing with predictions, we were tasked with bringing this feature to the UTraffic mobile app. Previously, we have shown how the feature will look like UI-wise, and we will work closely with the developing team of this idea to integrate it into the UTraffic system in the next phase of the project.
