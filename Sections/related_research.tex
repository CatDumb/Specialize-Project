\section{RELATED RESEARCH}

\subsection{Bus-Related Services}

Our research investigates a range of applications that provide services related to buses. Through a thorough analysis of established solutions within this field, our objective is to acquire insights that will guide the improvement of our application, thereby providing our audience with a more comprehensive and intuitive experience.

\subsubsection{FPT Ecosystem}

Besides Go!Bus TPHCM, FPT offers a wide set of choices for citizens to track traﬀic data, and these services are linked together. Most notably, the TTGT Tp Ho Chi Minh app allows users to see public cameras for traﬀic. We place particular emphasis on Go!Bus as it aligns with our project's focus, and Buyt TPHCM holds significance for data collection, as detailed in subsequent sections. These applications play pivotal roles in informing our research and development efforts.

\subsubsubsection{Go!Bus}

Fundamentally, Go!Bus offers solely bus-related services like bus stop searching, bus route searching, and routing. The app also has some support for Grab when routing. The home screen for the app is as follows:

    \caption{The home screen for Go!Bus.}
    \label{fig:gobus_homescreen}
\end{figure}

Nevertheless, during our testing of these features, none of them functioned. Here are a few examples of these occurrences.

        \label{fig:sub3}
        }

\end{figure}

It also portrayed some mobile app bad practices, such as embedding web views into the UI. Apple, in particular, is not fond of this approach and publicly stated that apps using this will not be accepted \cite{apple_webview}.

\subsubsubsection{Buyt TPHCM website}
Buyt TPHCM website \cite{buythcm} is an online resource designed to provide comprehensive information and tools for navigating the public bus system in Ho Chi Minh City. This website aims to enhance the accessibility and user experience of public transportation within the city by offering the following key functionalities:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Detailed route information:} The website provides users with comprehensive information on all bus routes in Ho Chi Minh City, including individual stop locations, schedules, and route maps.
    \item \textbf{Real-time bus arrival predictions:} To promote efficient travel planning, buyttphcm.com.vn offers real-time bus arrival predictions for all routes, allowing users to make informed decisions about their travel time.
    \item \textbf{Convenient tools and resources:} This website provides access to the Go!Bus mobile application, enabling users to easily purchase tickets and plan their bus journeys on the go. Additionally, users can find helpful information about the Public Transport Management Center and other relevant resources.
    \item \textbf{Up-to-date news and information:} buyttphcm.com.vn keeps users informed of the latest developments in the Ho Chi Minh City bus system, including temporary route changes, service disruptions, and new initiatives.
\end{itemize}

With its regularly updated resources, Buyt TP HCM will play a crucial role in our data collection process for bus stops and routes in the later stages of our project.

\subsubsection{BusMap}

BusMap rose as a prime solution for city navigation using buses. It also expanded into other regions and countries like Thailand and is overall doing well.

The fundamental bus services like searching and routing are executed well on BusMap, bar some UI lag that could be due to the excessive inclusion of map views. Users can see the bus locations that are coming their way with an estimated time of arrival. There are also other services offered by BusMap, such as JobMap, MotelMap, and driver license support. However, sections like "Blogs" and "News" might be unnecessary for most users.

\begin{figure}[H]

    \includegraphics[width=0.3\textwidth]{assets/images/Research/Bus/busmap_home.png}
    \caption{The home screen for BusMap}
    \label{fig:busmap_homescreen}
\end{figure}

\subsubsection{Conclusion}

Both of these apps share a common feature of being equipped with an abundance of supplementary services. While Go!Bus TPHCM is compatible with Grab, BusMap has diversified its partnerships to include other businesses. One apparent limitation of UTraffic is the lack of access to real-time data, such as the current locations of buses and the duration until the next journey. Nevertheless, with sufficient effort and development, our application can excel as a dependable routing and search engine. Ultimately, the primary function of UTraffic is to process congestion data; therefore, care must be taken not to delve too thoroughly into other domains.

\subsection{Data mining current bus stops and routes}

In our endeavor to enhance urban mobility and public transportation services in Ho Chi Minh City, we embark on a comprehensive research initiative focusing on the Buyt TPHCM website. This platform serves as a valuable resource for gathering essential data related to bus stops and routes.
