\subsection{Implemented APIs}

During our research to improve the performance and coherence of the application, we have come across some crucial APIs that are listed below:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Find Route by ID: /routes/route\_id} - Retrieve detailed information about a specific bus route.
    \item \textbf{Nearby Routes: /routes/nearby} - Discover nearby bus routes based on location.
    \item \textbf{Find Stops by Route: /routes/route\_id/stops} - Get a list of bus stops along a specific route.
    \item \textbf{Find Stops by Location: /stops/nearby} - Find bus stops near a given location.
    \item \textbf{Route Search: /routes/search} - Search for bus routes based on keywords or criteria.
\end{itemize}
