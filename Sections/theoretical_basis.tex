The OSM data file is structured around three fundamental elements:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Node}: Represents a singular point on the geographic map, defined by latitude, longitude, and a unique identifier (ID). Optional tag elements, children of a node, display metadata. Nodes can signify individual features (e.g., a specific bench) or combine to create paths or areas.
    \item \textbf{Way}: Comprises nodes forming a specific zone or line. Nodes within a way tag serve as vertices of a shape or path, referenced by the "ref" attribute. Ways can be open (with the initial and terminal nodes different) or closed (forming a closed shape). Open ways often represent linear features like roads or streams, while closed ways define boundaries, barriers, or territorial areas.
    \item \textbf{Relation}: An element with at least the "type=*" tag and a list of members (nodes, ways, or relations). Relations define logical or geographic connections between objects, such as a lake and its island or roads for a bus route. Members in a relation can have optional roles, describing their part within the relation. Members must be geometric elements or other relations, ensuring valid visibility on the map.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{iOS Application design patterns}

\subsubsection{Model-View-Controller (MVC)}

MVC is an architectural design pattern for building applications that separates the application into three main logical components: the model, the view, and the controller. In the MVC model:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Model}: Represents the data and business logic of the application. It is the "unchanging essence" of the application and should be stable and long-lived.

    \item \textbf{View}: Represents the user interface of the application. There can be multiple views for different devices, such as a web interface, mobile app, or command line interface.

    \item \textbf{Controller}: Handles user input and updates the model and view accordingly. It acts as an intermediary between the model and the view, processing business logic and managing data flow.
\end{itemize}

    \includegraphics[width=0.7\textwidth]{assets/images/Research/System/MVC.png}
    \caption{MVC architecture.}
    \label{fig:mvc}
\end{figure}

\subsubsection{Model-View-ViewModel (MVVM)}

MVVM architecture offers two-way data binding between view and view-model. The view-model makes use of observer pattern to make changes in the view-model. The components of MVVM are:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Model}: Holds the data and business logic. The model is independant of UI or user interaction.
    \item \textbf{View}: Represents how the user interacts with the application.
    \item \textbf{View-model}: Acts as a bridge between the view and the model. It provides data from the model to the view and handles user interaction with the view.
\end{itemize}
