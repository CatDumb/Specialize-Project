\subsection{Model}

\subsubsection{Model-View-Controller (MVC)}

MVC is an architectural design pattern for building applications that separates the application into three main logical components: the model, the view, and the controller. In the MVC model:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Model}: Represents the data and business logic of the application. It is the "unchanging essence" of the application and should be stable and long-lived.

    \item \textbf{View}: Represents the user interface of the application. There can be multiple views for different devices, such as a web interface, mobile app, or command line interface.

    \item \textbf{Controller}: Handles user input and updates the model and view accordingly. It acts as an intermediary between the model and the view, processing business logic and managing data flow.
\end{itemize}

Benefits of using MVC:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Separation of concerns}: Each component has a well-defined role, making the code easier to understand and maintain.
    \item \textbf{Improved testability}: Each component can be tested independently.
    \item \textbf{Increased flexibility}: Changes to one component can be made without affecting the others.
    \item \textbf{Easier collaboration}: Different developers can work on different components independently.
\end{itemize}

                        \item Increased complexity
                        \item Increased development time

\subsubsection{Model-View-ViewModel (MVVM)}

MVVM architecture offers two-way data binding between view and view-model. The view-model makes use of observer pattern to make changes in the view-model. The components of MVVM are:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Model}: Holds the data and business logic. The model is independant of UI or user interaction.
    \item \textbf{View}: Represents how the user interacts with the application.
    \item \textbf{View-model}: Acts as a bridge between the view and the model. It provides data from the model to the view and handles user interaction with the view.
\end{itemize}
