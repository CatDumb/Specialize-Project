                  UIWebView API, we strongly encourage you to update to
                  WKWebView as soon as possible for improved security and
                  reliability. WKWebView ensures that compromised web content
                  doesn't affect the rest of an app by limiting web processing
                  to the app's web view. And it's supported in iOS and macOS,
                  and by Mac Catalyst.The App Store will no longer accept new
                  apps using UIWebView as of April 2020 and app updates using
                  UIWebView as of December 2020.Learn more about WKWebView},
